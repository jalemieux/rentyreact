Like many of you I own and rent houses. And over the years Iâ€™ve build up a process to evaluate properties. At the center of this evaluation process is a spreadsheet. It is the result of hours spent reading about real estate investing, working with agents and lenders. It takes into account all kinds of factors, from taxes to deb ratio to reserve requirements. As I found myself using it more and more often, I wished for a portable version and so decided to make an app version. It is available at http://rentd.me . It's free. No gimmick. I hope I can help you as much as it's helping me.  

TL;DR: free, comprehensive affordability and cash flow calculators at http://rentd.me
